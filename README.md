OSI vs TCP/IP Model Visualizer

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive visualization and educational tool designed to compare the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model with the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model. It provides a clear breakdown of the similarities and differences between the two models, helping students and beginners in networking understand how data flows in computer networks.

The tool was created as part of a school assignment to demonstrate concepts in computer networking using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Aim of the Project

The main objectives are:
* To visualize the layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models.
* To show how the 7 OSI layers map onto the 4 TCP/IP layers.
* To help students better understand network communication.
* To make the learning process more interactive and engaging.

## Project Structure

* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) → Contains all explanations, diagrams, and visualizations.
* Python code → Used for generating animations and plots.
* Explanatory text → Guides the reader through each networking layer.

## Features

✅ Interactive visualization of OSI vs TCP/IP models
✅ Step-by-step explanation of each layer
✅ Mapping of OSI layers to TCP/IP layers
✅ Simple and beginner-friendly
✅ Can be used for teaching, presentations, or self-study

## Technologies Used

Python
Matplotlib / Plotly (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive explanation)
